## Materials
Using NEO SDS Mk4, CTRE Mag Encoders, Pigeon 2 IMU. Simple Swerve Code for Falcon Motors, CTRE CANCoder, and CTRE Pigeon Gyro
This code is tailored for Swerve Drive Specialties MK3, MK4, and MK4i modules but can be easily adapted for other module styles.

## Controller Mappings
This code is configured for Xbox controller usage:
- Left Stick: Translation Control (forwards and sideways movement)
- Right Stick: Rotation Control
- Y button: Zero Gyro
- Left Bumper: Switches to Robot Centric Control while held
